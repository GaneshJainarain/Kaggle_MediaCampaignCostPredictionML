# Media Campaign Cost Prediction 

The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Media Campaign Cost Prediction dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

### About Dataset

Food Mart (CFM) is a chain of convenience stores in the United States. The private company's headquarters are located in Mentor, Ohio, and currently, approximately 325 stores are located in the US. Convenient Food Mart operates on the franchise system.

The NASDAQ exchange dropped Convenient Food Mart the same year when the company failed to meet financial reporting requirements.

Carden & Cherry advertised Convenient Food Mart with the Ernest character in the 1980s.
Your Task is to devise a Machine Learning Model that helps us predict the cost of media campaigns in the food marts on the basis of the features provided.
